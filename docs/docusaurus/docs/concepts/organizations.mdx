#### Organizations and Data

An organization can authenticate itself to perform service-to-service actions (API calls). This way:
- An organization can create [boxes](boxes.mdx).
- An organization pushes end-to-end encrypted messages to their boxes: [see this guide](guides/store-data-for-your-org.mdx).

#### Users and Organizations

Being connected on [Misakey app](https://app.misakey.com):
- Anyone can create an organization. The creator is the administrator of the organization: [see this guide](/guides/your-org.mdx#creation-of-a-boxs).
- Administrators can create [datatags](datatags.mdx) for their organizations: [see this guide](/guides/store-data-for-your-org.mdx#create-datatags).
