### Client Credentials Flow

The endpoint follows the [OAuth2.0 protocol for Access Token Request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4.2) and
 [Access Token Response](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4.3).

#### Request

_Endpoint_:
```bash
POST https://auth.misakey.com/_/oauth2/token
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

_Request Body_:
```
grant_type=client_credentials&scope=&client_id=14737581-2073-4413-8bcc-e7c6f614324d&client_secret=4m7xvY1EK3G5pEv+m5nMmGyrkWxyiWu/M78fFtD2Xl0=
```
with
- `grant_type`: (string) _client_credentials_ must be set as it is the flow requested. Others would lead to a failure error.
- `scope`: (string) should be empty. We don't handle special scope for organization as off today.
- `client_id`: (string) (uuid) the unique id of your organization.
- `client_secret`: (string) the secret of your organization.

##### Response

_Response Headers_:
```bash
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

_Response Body_:
```json
{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "scope": ""
}
```

with:
- `access_token`: (string) the bearer token owning your organization authorizations.
- `token_type`: (string) the type of token delivered (always set to _bearer_).
- `expires_in`: (integer) the number of seconds before the token will expire. A new token must be generated at this moment. Ideally you should renew it just before the last delivered is expired.
- `scope`: (string) scopes contained in the token. An empty string today.
