# Introduction

A box is a space where the end-identity can share securely the data with some other identity or themself.

It is the base for data exchange, data access management...

# Boxes

## Creating a Box

### Request

```bash
  POST https://api.misakey.com/boxes
```

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): no identity check, just a valid token is required.
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_JSON Body:_
```json
    {
      "title": "RequÃªte RGPD",
      "owner_org_id": "d1e9bfa6-e931-46b1-b73c-77cb3530aadb",
      "datatag_id": "b7073bc5-b2e8-4a22-9717-8418de13bfa5",
      "data_subject": "michel@misakey.com",
      "public_key": "SXvalkvhuhcj2UiaS4d0Q3OeuHOhMVeQT7ZGfCH2YCw",
      "key_share": {
        "misakey_share": "lBHT1vfwFAIBig5Nj_sD_w",
        "other_share_hash": "Nz4nJMj5DOd4UGXXOlH8Ww",
        "encrypted_invitation_key_share": "cGYMzgIO9rc03WoSLAyoiQdLu7he5VbMRImLhRPmwTQ"
      }
      "invitation_data": {
        "<public key>": "encrypted crypto action"
       }
    }
```

- `title` is a free text required that is meant to describe the box purpose.
- `owner_org_id` is an optional uuid corresponding to the organization owning the box (default is self org).
- `datatag_id` is an **optional** uuid corresponding to a datatag representing the data type shipped through this box. `owner_org_id` must also bit set.
- `datatag_subject` is an **optional** identifier to define the data subject of this box.
- `public_key` and `other_share_hash` must be in **unpadded url-safe base64**. If the public key is for `com.misakey.aes-rsa-enc` algorithm, it must be prefixed with `com.misakey.aes-rsa-enc:`.
- `key_share` is **optional** but will be soon mandatory.
- `invitation_data` is **optional** but must be used if the `datatag_subject` has an account. It contains the encrypted crypto action to directly invite the user (see the `extra` field in the [access events section](../../concepts/box-events/#2511-to-a-specific-identifier-value))

When a box is created, it already contains a first event
of type `create` that contains most of the information about the creation of the box.

Note that the access mode of a box is limited by default. A `state.access_mode` event must be created to switch it to `public`, see the related event type documentation.

### Response

_
```bash
HTTP 201 Created
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/box.json" %}}
```

The most important part is the `id` field
which must be used to interact with the box.

## Getting a Box

### Request

```bash
  GET https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id
```

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): no identity check, just a valid token is required.
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_Path Parameters:_
- `id` (uuid string): the box id wished to be retrieved.

### Response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/box-read.json" %}}
```

### notable error reponses

**I - The identity has no access to the box

The reason of the forbidden is explained is a reason field that have only 2 possible fixed values.
Only the get box endpoint is ensured to return this error in the current state of the API.

```bash
HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
    "code": "forbidden",
    "origin": "not_defined",
    "desc": "",
    "details": {
        "reason": "no_access|not_member"
    }
}
```

## Getting public info about a box

This endpoint does not need any valid token, but it needs a valid `other_share_hash`
corresponding to the box to get.

### Request

```bash
  GET https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id/public?other_share_hash=
```

_Path Parameters:_
- `id` (uuid string): the box id wished to be retrieved.

_Query Parameters:_
- `other_share_hash` (string) (unpadded url-safe base64): a hash of the other share.

### Response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
    "title": "<title of the box>",
    "owner_org_id": "<uuid representing the organization owning the box>",
    "creator": {{% include "include/event-identity.json" %}}
}
```
## Delete a box

[Box admins](../../concepts/box-events/#21-admins) only are able to delete corresponding boxes.

A removed box sees its data completely removed from Misakey storage. This action is irreversible.

This action removes all data related to the box (events, key-shares...).

### Request

```bash
DELETE https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id
```

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): the linked identity must be considered as a [box admin](../concepts/box-events/#21-admins).
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_Path Parameters:_
- `id` (uuid string): the box id wished to be deleted.

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "user_confirmation": "delete"
}
```

- `user_confirmation` (string) (one of: _delete_, _supprimer_): the input the end-identity has entered to confirm the deletion. The server will check if the value corresponds to some expected strings (cf one of).

### Response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 204 NO CONTENT
```

## Reset the new events count for an identity

The list of boxes return many information for each boxes, including a numerical field `events_count` telling how many event have occured since the connected identity's last visit.

This endpoint allows to reset the new events count of a box for a given identity.

It is a kind of an acknowledgement and it must be used when the identity want to mark the box as "read".

### Request

```bash
PUT https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id/new-events-count/ack
```

_Path Parameter:_
- `id` (string) (uuid): the box id to mark as "read"

_JSON Body:_
```json
    {
        "identity_id": "e2e49259-f840-4991-a9f7-97c5f267bd18"
    }
```

where `identity_id` is the identity of the requester who wants to acknowledge.

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): a valid access token corresponding to the identity of the body
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

### success response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 204 NO CONTENT
```
