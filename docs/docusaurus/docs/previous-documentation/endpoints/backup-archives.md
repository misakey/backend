title: Backup Archives
---


A new backup archive is created whenever a user successfully performs a “forgotten password” procedure.
The purpose of a backup archive is to keep a copy of the user's secret backup
(see [endpoints related to account](/endpoints/accounts))
at the time the password reset happenned,
since reseting a user's password implies to overwrite her backup with an empty new one.

After a backup archive has been created,
the user can attempt to decrypt it
(by remembering the password that was lost, or providing the corresponding backup key).

The user can ask the backend to delete a backup archive,
typically if she fears the corresponding password or backup key might have been exposed.

The frontend will also request the deletion of an archive after it has been successfully recovered.
