            "title": "<string> User1 - User2",
            "public_key": "<string> SXvalkvhuhcj2UiaS4d0Q3OeuHOhMVeQT7ZGfCH2YCw",

# Box Settings

The box settings are unique per user settings for a given box.

We donâ€™t manage it with events because it is specific to each user and does not describe
the box state.

It is stored in a different place and is not returned with the actual box.
