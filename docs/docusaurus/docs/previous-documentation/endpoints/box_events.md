title: Box Events
---

# Introduction

Boxes contain *events* that have a *type*.
In practice, most events will be of type `msg.text` or `msg.file`,
corresponding to the sending of messages (with either text or files in it) to the box.
There are however a few other events,
most of them describing a change of the *state* of the box.

[The shape and rules for box events are described here.](/concepts/box-events)

# Events on boxes

## SINGLE creation of an event for a box

This endpoint allows the creation of events of a specific box.
Considering the type of event, side effects will occurs.

:information_source: [The shape and rules for box events are described here.](/concepts/box-events)

This endpoint does not allow the creation of all type of event though. Some require to use different routes to be created as a side effect:
- `create` type events are created by the server [during the creation of the box](#creating-a-box).
- `msg.file` type events are created by the server [during the upload of an encrypted file](#upload-an-encrypted-file-to-a-box).
- `access.*` type events can only be created using [events batch creation](#batch-creation-of-events-for-a-box).
- `member.kick` type events are created by the server [during the removal of an access](/previous-documentation/concepts/box-events/#kick).
