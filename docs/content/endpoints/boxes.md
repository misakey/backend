# 1. Introduction

A box is a space where the end-user can share securely the data with some other user or themself.

It is the base for data exchange, data access management...

# 2. Boxes

## 2.1. Creating a Box

### 2.1.1. request

```bash
  POST https://api.misakey.com/boxes
```

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): no identity check, just a valid token is required.
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_JSON Body:_
```json
    {
      "title": "RequÃªte RGPD",
      "owner_org_id": "d1e9bfa6-e931-46b1-b73c-77cb3530aadb",
      "public_key": "SXvalkvhuhcj2UiaS4d0Q3OeuHOhMVeQT7ZGfCH2YCw",
      "key_share": {
        "misakey_share": "lBHT1vfwFAIBig5Nj+sD+w==",
        "other_share_hash": "Nz4nJMj5DOd4UGXXOlH8Ww",
        "encrypted_invitation_key_share": "cGYMzgIO9rc03WoSLAyoiQdLu7he5VbMRImLhRPmwTQ="
      }
    }
```

- `title` is a free text required that is meant to describe the box purpose.
- `owner_org_id` is an optional uuid corresponding to the organization owning the box (default is self org).
- `public_key` and `other_share_hash` must be in **unpadded url-safe base64**.
- `key_share` is **optional** but will be soon mandatory.

When a box is created, it already contains a first event
of type `create` that contains most of the information about the creation of the box.

Note that the access mode of a box is limited by default. A `state.access_mode` event must be created to switch it to `public`, see the related event type documentation.

### 2.1.2. response

_
```bash

corresponding to the box to get.

  GET https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id/public?other_share_hash=

```
## 2.4. Delete a box

[Box admins](../../concepts/box-events/#21-admins) only are able to delete corresponding boxes.

A removed box sees its data completely removed from Misakey storage. This action is irreversible.

This action removes all data related to the box (events, key-shares...).

### 2.4.1. request

```bash
DELETE https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id
```

  "user_confirmation": "delete"
}
```

```bash
HTTP 204 NO CONTENT
```

This endpoint allows to reset the new events count of a box for a given identity.

It is a kind of an acknowledgement and it must be used when the user want to mark the box as "read".

```json
    {
        "identity_id": "e2e49259-f840-4991-a9f7-97c5f267bd18"
    }
```

where `identity_id` is the identity of the requester who wants to acknowledge.

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): a valid access token corresponding to the identity of the body
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

### 2.5.2. success response
