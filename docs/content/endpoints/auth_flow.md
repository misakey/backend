# 1. Introduction

Performing an auth flow is the only to obtain an access token and ID token.
This section provides all the routes the frontend SSO application might use.

All routes described in the sequence diagram are not specified in this document.
Most of them do no reuqire specific frontend logic. Only theÂ user's agent redirect
is required.

Routes are ordered consedering the expected way they should be called.

An auth flow is linked to both authorization and authentication.
A description of these concepts can be found in the [Authorization & Authentication specification](../../concepts/authorization-and-authentication/).
It is probably worth to read before implement following routes.


**Authentication information**:

The final ID Token contains information about the authentication performed by the user.

See [the list of **Authentication Method References** and corresponding **Authentication Context Classes**](../../concepts/authorization-and-authentication/#43-methods) for more info.

## 1.1. Overall auth flow

As of today:
- `app.misakey.com`: the frontend client
- `auth.misakey.com/_`: the Ory Hydra service
- `api.misakey.com`: the backend service responsible for authentication

## 1.2. Initiate an authorization code flow

### 1.2.1. request

```bash
  GET https://auth.misakey.com/_/oauth2/auth
```

_Query Parameters:_
- see [Open ID Connect RFC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest).

### 1.2.2. success response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 302 FOUND
```

_Headers:_
- `Location`: https://api.misakey.com/auth/login?login_challenge=4f112272f2fa4cbe939b04e74dd3e49e

    <a href="https://api.misakey.com/auth/login?login_challenge=4f112272f2fa4cbe939b04e74dd3e49e">Found</a>
```

The `Location` header contains the same URL than the HTML body. The user's agent should be redirected to this URL to continue the auth flow to the login flow.

# 2. Login Flow

## 2.1. Get Login Information

This route is used to retrieve information about the current login flow using a login challenge.

### 2.1.1. request

## 2.2. Require an identity for a given identifier

This request is idempotent.

This route is used to retrieve information the identity the end-user will log in.

The identity can be a new one created for the occasion or an existing one.
See _Response_ below for more information.

### 2.2.1. request

_Headers:_
- The request doesn't require an authorization header.

```bash
PUT https://api.misakey.com/auth/identities
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
	"login_challenge": "e45f579fd02d41adbf8cb45e0f6a44ff",
  "identifier_value": "auth@test.com",

}
```

- `login_challenge` (string): can be found in preivous redirect URL.
- `identifier_value` (string): the identifier value the end-user has entered.
- `password_reset` (bool): a boolean to initiate a new password reset flow.

### 2.2.2. success response

This route returns the identity the end-user will login as.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "identity": {
    "display_name": "MUCHMICHMACH@test.com",
    "avatar_url": null,
    "account_id": "5f80b4ec-b42a-4554-a738-4fb532ba2ee4", 
  },
  "authn_step": {
    "identity_id": "4a98b5a1-1c08-46c9-8f26-18d54cbed30a",
    "method_name": "(possibilities described below)",
    "metadata": (format described in the next section)
  },
}
```

- `identity` (object): the identity linked to the received identifier value.
  - `display_name` (string): a customizable display name.
  - `avatar_url` (string) (nullable): the web address of the end-user avatar file.
  - `account_id` (string) (nullable): the potential account id linked to the identity.
- `authn_step` (object): the preferred authentication step:
  - `identity_id` (uuid string): the unique identity id the authentication step is attached to.
  - `method_name` (string) (one of: _emailed_code_, _prehashed_password_, _account_creation): the preferred authentication method.
  - `metadata` (string) (nullable): filled considering the preferred method.

### 2.2.3. possible formats for the `metadata` field

Considering the preferred authentication method, the metadata can contain additional information.

#### 2.2.3.1. method name: **emailed_code**

```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "emailed_code",
  "metadata": null,
  [...]
}
```

#### 2.2.3.2. method name: **prehashed_password**

On `prehashed_password`, the `metadata` field contains information about how the password is supposed to be prehashed.

:warning: Warning, the metadata has not the exact same shape as [the metadata used to perform
an authentication step](./#possible-formats-for-the-metadata-field-1) using the `prehashed_password` method, which also contains the hash of the password.

```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "prehashed_password",
  "metadata": {{% include "include/hashParameters.json" 2 %}},
  [...]
}
```

#### 2.2.3.3. method name: **account_creation** :bust_in_silhouette:

```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "account_creation",
  "metadata": null,
  [...]
}
```

This is the only way to create an account linked to an identity.

:information_source: This method is returned by the server in a certain configuration.

This method is retured when:
- the final ACR is expected to be 2.
- the identity linked to the given identifier has no linked account.
- the end-user has provided a valid login session corresponding to a previous ACR 1 authentication.

:information_source: The authorization server might return first an `emailed_code` authn step in order to prove the user owns the identifier.
:mag: The `account_creation` will then come as a second authn step as a [More Authentication Required Response](http://localhost:1313/endpoints/auth_flow/#622-the-more-authentication-required-response).
:information_source: This step is skipped if the end-user has provided a valid login session corresponding to a previous ACR 1 authentication.

#### 2.2.3.4. method name: **webauthn**


```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "webauthn",
  "metadata":
      {
          "publicKey": {
              "challenge":"<string>",
              "timeout":<int>,
              "rpId":"<string>",
              "allowCredentials":[{
                  "type":"<string>",
                  "id":"<string>"
              },{
                  "type":"<string>",
                  "id":"<string>"
              }]
          }
    },
    [...]
}
```

The metadata content is defined and explained in the webauthn documentation.

#### 2.2.3.5. method name: **totp**


```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "totp",
  "metadata": null,
    [...]
}
```

#### 2.2.3.6. method name: **reset_password**

This method must only be used at the end of the flow.

This will set a new password for the given identity.

```json
{

  [...]
  "method_name": "reset_password",
  "metadata": null,
    [...]
}
```

## 2.3. Perform an authentication step in the login flow

The next step to authenticate the end-user is to let them enter some information
assuring they own the identity. This is called an **authentication step**.

Some login flow will require many steps later but as of today, we only have one step
even for our most secure flows.

The metadata field contained in the authentication step depends of the method name.

### 2.3.1. request

```bash
POST https://api.misakey.com/auth/login/authn-step
```

_Headers:_
- The request doesn't require an authorization header.

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "login_challenge": "e2645a0592e94ee78d8fbeaf65a4b82b",
  "authn_step": {
    "identity_id": "53515d02-642a-4043-a943-bb11c0bdc6a5",
    "method_name": "(possibilities defined in the next section)",
    "metadata": "(formats defined in the next section)"
  }
}
```

- `login_challenge` (string): can be found in previous redirect URL.
- `authn_step` (object): the performed authentication step information:
  - `identity_id` (uuid string): the identity id.
  - `method_name` (string) (one of: _emailed\_code_, _prehashed\_password_, _account\_creation_, _webauthn_, _totp_): the authentication method used.
  - `metadata` (json object): metadata containing the emailed code value, the prehashed password or the webauthn options.
The list of possible formats is defined in the next section.

#### 2.3.1.1. Possible formats for the `metadata` field

This section describes the possible metadata format, as a JSON object, which is a
field contained in the JSON body of the previous section.

The context of this specification is the performing of an authentication step only.

##### 2.3.1.1.1. method name: **emailed_code**

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "emailed_code",
  "metadata": {
    "code": "320028"
  },
  [...]
}
```

##### 2.3.1.1.2. method name: **prehashed_password**

:warning: Warning, the metadata has not the exact same shape as [the metadata returned requiring
an identity](./#possible-formats-for-the-metadata-field) with the `prehashed_password` value as preferred method, which contains only the hash parameters of the password.

```json
{
  [...]
  "method_name": "prehashed_password",
  "metadata": {{% include "include/passwordHash.json" 2 %}},
  [...]
}
```

##### 2.3.1.1.3. method name: **account_creation**

:mag: The `prehashed_password` contains information following [Argon2 server relief concepts](../../concepts/server-relief/).

### 2.3.2. success response

On success, the route can return two possible json body:

#### 2.3.2.1. the "redirect" response

What is returned is the next URL the user's agent should be redirected to.
This response is given when the authentication server consider the end-user has proven its identity sufficiently.

The access token is sent and stored in an http-only cookie.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "next": "redirect",
  "redirect_to": "https://auth.misakey.com/_/oauth2/auth",
  "csrf_token": "3eb193b251a24dcb8bb5aa5c3cca3487"
}
```

- `next` (oneof: _redirect_, _authn_step_): the next action the authentication server is waiting for.
- `redirect_to` (string): the URL the user's agent should be redirected to.

#### 2.3.2.2. the "more authentication required" response

What is returned is the next authentication step the end-user should perform.
This response is given when the authentication server requires more authentication step to proove the end-user identity.

Technically, it happens when the current ACR, corresponding to previously validated authentication steps (a.k.a. AMRs), is below the expected ACR.

The expected ACR can be set by:
- the Relying Party expectations: `acr_values` paramenter on the init of the auth flow.
- the choosen identity configuration.

Also part of the response, an access token that must be used for the next request as an `accesstoken` cookie. This token allows us to authorize more advanced calls.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "next": "authn_step",
  "authn_step": {
    "identity_id": "53515d02-642a-4043-a943-bb11c0bdc6a5",
    "method_name": "...",
    "metadata": "..."
  },
  "access_token": "NaEOLikFLklPERz1Cq-umthWAXKBgwWQ-S3cmWqWt8Q.fPAN_Hxyp8eFRQ0zPT5_lNcFANXENcYGlgLiUrS2xY4"
}
```

- `next` (oneof: _redirect_, _authn_step_): the next action the authentication server is waiting for.
- `access_token` (string): an access token allowing more advanced requests while being still in the login flow. Should be used as `Authorization` header.
- `authn_step` (object): the next expected authn step to end the login flow.

:mag: `method_name` and `metadata` possibilities are defined in [the require identity section](#possible-formats-for-the-metadata-field).

### 2.3.3. notable error responses

On error during an authentication step, some information might be displayed to the end-user.

**1. Received codeÂ is invalid:**

This error occurs when the code received in metadata does not match any stored code.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "code": "forbidden",
  "origin": "body",
  "details": {
    "code": "invalid",
  },
}
```

**2. Received code has expired:**

This error occurs when the code received in metadata is correct but the timebox
to use it is expired.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "code": "forbidden",
  "origin": "body",
  "details": {
    "code": "expired",
  },
}
```

**3. The Authorization headers do not correspond to the login_challenge:**

Situation when the error is returned:
1. The end-user has performed an authentication step in a login flow A.
2. The end-user refreshes their agent, it inits a new login flow B.
3. The client has still the access token bound to the login flow A in headers.

The access token is valid for the login flow A but cannot be used in the login flow B.

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{
  "code": "forbidden",
  "origin": "headers",
  "desc": "...",
  "details": {
    "Authorization": "conflict",
    "login_challenge": "conflict"
  }
}
```

HTTP 204 NO CONTENT
```

### 2.4.4. notable error responses

On errors, some information should be displayed to the end-user.

**1. A similar authn step already exists:**

This error occurs when an authentication step already exists for this `identity_id` and `method_name`

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 409 Conflict
```

```json
{
  "code": "conflict",
  "origin": "body",
  "desc": "initing an authn step: a code has already been generated",
  "details": {
      "identity_id": "conflict",
      "method_name": "conflict"
  }
}
```

**2. Impossible to perform a prehashed_password method with the identity:**
