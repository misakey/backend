# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Concept

**Identity** is the core entity used for authorization and authentication at Misakey.

They are auto-generated: the system consider a new wild identity appears when an
unknown identifier is entered during a login flow.

They refer then to an identifier (email, phone number...) and they are optionally attached to [an account](../accounts/).

End-users can claim an identity by creating an account on it or link an existing account.

They can be considered both as profiles and concrete identities. Users have many identities:
- as citizens: having both Korean and Russian nationalities...
- as internet fellows: having a Travian account and a Mastodon account...

## 1.2. Resource Access

Resources access is based on the identity the end-user is logged in.

The end-user can select the identity they want to be logged in during the auth flow,
or in the interface at any moment.

There is no need to re-authenticate switching identities unless the security level
of an identity is higher than the current one the end-user is logged in.

# 2. Base Identity

## 2.1. Require an identity for a given identifier

Described in [the auth flow section](../auth_flow/#5-require-an-identity-for-a-given-identifier).

## 2.2. Create an account on an identity

Described [in the accounts section](../accounts/#2-create-an-account-on-an-identity)

## 2.3. Get an identity

This route allows the retrieval of the information related to an identity.

### 2.3.1. request

```bash
GET https://api.misakey.com/identities/:id
```
_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): `mid` claim as the identity id.
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_Path Parameters:_
- `id` (uuid string): the identity unique id.

### 2.3.2. success response

# 3. Identity Profiles

End-users can configure their identities to show more or less information publicly about them (email, phone number...).

By default, everything is hidden and only the display name is public.
Anyone (even not connected people) can access an identity profile page. Only the username is required to get it.

## 3.1. Get an identity profile

### 3.1.1. request

It is not mandatory to have any authorization nor session to call this endpoint.
