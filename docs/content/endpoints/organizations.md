# 1. Introduction

An organization is created by an end-user. Inside it, they can create boxes and administrate them. These boxes are then owned by the organization.

There is always at least one organization within the system, corresponding to what is called the "self org".
The "self org" corresponds to the Open ID Provider client and represents the instance of the system running.

While end-users create boxes in their personal space, it is linked to this self-organization which represent then the personal space for all the users on this instance.
Self organization has no administrators, the data linked to it belongs to the end-users that have created it.
