title: Store data for your organization
---

In order to store data for your organization on Misakey, you must first follow [this guide](/guides/your-org.mdx), after which you should:
- have created an organization.
- have generated a secret for your organization.
- have generated an access token for your organization.


### Create datatags

[Datatags](/concepts/datatags.mdx) are really important to identify what the data is about: for your organization, your users, and other organizations. We advise you to create at least one datatag corresponding to the kind of data you are storing, even if the term is non-specialist: _all_, _{name_of_your_org_}_data_, _purchases_, _contracts_...

:information_source: A lot of features will come with datatags, so it can be important to set them up correctly from the beginning.

[See the datatag reference](references/datatags.mdx).

### Create a box for a data subject and datatag

You can create a box and then send data to it.

1. [Create a box](references/boxes.mdx#creation-of-a-box-for-your-organizations).
2. Send data to the box:
    * [As plain text](references/boxes.mdx#send-data-as-a-plain-text-to-a-box).
    * [As a file](references/boxes.mdx#send-data-as-a-file-to-a-box).
