:::info
SDK Integration are not ready for production yet. This article is here to inform you on the principle we aim. 
If you need a SDK for your integration, feel free to contact us ([love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)) to give us insight of the importance for you.

## General consideration

Misakey tech aims to help every website or application to get a clean way to manage their user authentication and user data management.

We provide a service that you run on your infrastructure (or you can use us in SaaS if you prefer, see [CMS integration](/guides/cms-integration.md) for more info). Most of the processing are done in this service. You just have to integrate our SDKs to your app to be able to communicate with the service.

As everything we do is open source, if you have the right skills, you can develop missing SDKs if you need it !

## What are doing SDKs ?

### Frontend SDK

Frontend SDK are used for multiple features:
- Authentication launch and termination
- End-to-end encryption management: encrypting and decrypting data
- External service data browsing
- Consent requesting

### Backend SDK

- Access management definition
- Data model management
- Programmatic data access 
- Messaging 

## Which SDKs are available ?

For now, we don't have any SDK that are ready to be used in production. We have a pragmatic approach for integration development: we don't want to develop integrations that won't be used. So if you would use Misakey with a specific language for your app, tell us ([love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)) !
