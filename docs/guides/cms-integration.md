:::info
CMS Integration are not ready for production yet. This article is here to inform you on the principle we aim. 
If you need a CMS integration, feel free to contact us ([love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)) to give us insight of the importance for you.

## General consideration

Misakey tech aims to help every website or application to get a clean way to manage their user authentication and user data management.

All people cannot integrate the tech using our APIs and SDKs, that require some development skills. This is why we are developing some integrations with majors CMS and e-commerce engines (Wordpress, Prestashop, ...). 

As everything we do is open source, if you have the right skills, you can develop missing CMS integrations if you need it !

## Which CMS are available ?

For now, we don't have any integration that are ready to be used in production. We have a pragmatic approach for integration development: we don't want to develop integrations that won't be used. So if you would use Misakey on a CMS for your site, tell us ([love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)) !
