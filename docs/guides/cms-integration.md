:::info
CMS Integration are not ready for production yet. This page is only here to give you a glimpse on how they will work.
If you need a CMS for a specific technology, feel free to contact us ([love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)).
:::

## General Consideration

Misakey aims at helping every website and application to get a clean user management and personal data management.

Not all people or projects can use APIs and SDKs. This is why we are developing some integrations with majors CMS and e-commerce engines (Wordpress, Prestashop, ...). 

Since everything we do is open source, if you have the right skills you can even develop your own CMS integration!

## Which CMS are available ?

For now, we don't have any integration that are ready to be used in production. We have a pragmatic approach for integration development: we don't want to develop integrations that won't be used. So if you would use Misakey on a CMS for your site, tell us at [love@misakey.com](mailto:love@misakey.com)!
