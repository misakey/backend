:::info
The migration to the new documentation is in progress
:::

Welcome to our previous API documentation.

**Remark:** most of the API is described by examples
more than by rigorous formal specification.
For instance when you see a UUID somewhere,
you should understand that the value at this location must be an UUID,
not that it must be *this exact UUID* (which wouldn't make sense anyway).

#### Global rules
* All time strings are represented following the [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), ex `2038-11-05T00:00:00.000Z`.
* All request and response parameters described in following specifications are **required** or **always returned**,
unless other rules are locally specified.
