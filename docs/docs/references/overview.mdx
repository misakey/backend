Most of our API documentation is currently available [here](/old-doc/home).

We aim to move it completely here: the work is in progress :hammer_and_wrench:...

### Global Documentation Rules

In the following specifications:
- All parameters are **required** or **always returned**, unless other rules are locally specified. This is applied for both requests and responses.

### Global Formats

- Date and Time strings are represented following the RFC 3339, ex `2038-11-05T00:00:00.000Z`.
- Query Parameter Lists are comma separated lists of words: ex `lists=one,two,three`
- [Errors format have a dedicated page](/docs/references/errors-format).

### Pagination

#### Parameters

Pagination is currently handled using an `limit` and an `offset` integers.

In case of HTTP calls, these command information is received using query parameters.

On endpoint offering pagination, it is usual to have a default value for both of these parameters:
- `offset` default value is always 0.
- `limit` default value depends on the endpoint.

The `limit` parameter sets the maximum number of entities contained by the returned list. It is the size of the page.

The `offset` parameter sets the cursor in the total list of stored entities. It is kind of the page number.

##### Example:

Considering the list of numbers: **[10, 32, 554, 6, 0.1]**.

- `limit = 0 & offset = 0` --> `[10, 32, 554, 6, 0.1]`
- `limit = 2 & offset = 0` --> `[10, 32]`
- `limit = 2 & offset = 1` --> `[32, 554]`
- `limit = 2 & offset = 3` --> `[6, 0.1]`
- `limit = 2 & offset = 3` --> `[6, 0.1]`
- `limit = 2 & offset = 4` --> `[0.1]` _we have only one record to return_
- `limit = 2 & offset = 5` --> `[]` _no record to return_
- `limit = 10 & offset = 1` --> `[32, 554, 6, 0.1]`

#### How to know the total count ?

The total count of existing entities is usually available as on the same route using the HEAD verb instead of the GET.
A Response Header `X-Total-Count` is then returned as an integer.

It might exist some listing endpoints not having its HEAD equivalent implemented, please contact us if you wish it.

#### When to stop calling the endpoint if I want to retrieve all the existing entities ?

The consumer should stop calling the list when the number of returned entities is lower than the received limit.
