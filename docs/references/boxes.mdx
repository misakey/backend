### Creation of a box

A box can be created using [the box creation endpoint](https://backend.docs.misakey.dev/endpoints/boxes/#21-creating-a-box).

The box can be created with an optional datatag and an optional data subject.

The data subject is supposed to be the email of the person concerned by the data.
After being connected on Misakey using this email, data subjects can see boxes you have created and linked to their email. They have access to the box and its data.

:::info
Do not forget to save the id of the created box to later send data to it.
