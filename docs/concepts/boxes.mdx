> A box is a confidential space within the context of an organization where the data is shared between users, machines using end-to-end encryption.

Boxes are end-to-end encrypted data storage where all accesses are controlled through box configuration and data subject's consent. They can also be used as data pipes.

More information [here](/references/boxes.mdx).

Once a box is created, there are some concepts holding the box one:
- Messages: the data shared in the box.
- Accesses: the rules defining what identities can join the box.
- Members: the identities having joined the box.
