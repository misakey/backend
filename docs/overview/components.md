## Backend Stack Services

Misakey tech is based on a robust backend that will manage the different features:
- Unified authentication based on [Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- Consent platform
- User data management
- Notifications server
- Messaging engine
- End-to-end encryption infrastructure

## Frontend for Authentication

A generic frontend is provided by default to manage the authentication and consent steps. This frontend is customizable, but you can also create your own and integrate backend integration with the SDKs.

The frontend provides multiple features, and new ones are added on a regular basis:
- Passwordless auth (email confirmation)
- Sign-up / Sing-in 
- Muti-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)
- [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/)
- Consent management (TOS/Privacy policy, data access consent)

## SDKs and UI Kit for Building Apps

We are providing SDKs and a UI kit to integrate the Misakey technology in any existing or new application. They allow integration with all the features provided by the backend:
- Authentication
- Access to user data
- Notification system
- Messaging
- End-to-end encryption

## CMS Plugins for One Click Integration

We are developing some plugins for popular CMS (Wordpress, Prestashop, ...) to for easy integration.

We are looking for new software to integrate with, so feel free to suggest new integrations or to contribute to ongoing ones (see next section)!
