## Backend stack services

Misakey tech is based on a robust backend that will manage the different features:
- Unified authentication (based on OIDC)
- Consent platform
- User data management
- Notifications server
- Messaging engine
- End-to-end encryption infrastructure

## Frontend for authentication

By default, a generic frontend is proposed to manage the authentication and consent steps. This frontend is customizable, but you can also create your own one and integrate backend integration with the SDKs.

The frontend proposes multiple features (that are maintained and new ones are developed regularly:
- Passwordless auth (email confirmation)
- Sign-up / Sing-in 
- MFA
- WebauthN
- Consent management (TOS/Privacy policy, data access consent)

## SDKs and UIKit for building apps

We are providing SDKs and UI kit to integrate the technology in any existing or new application. Those SDKs and UI Kit are useful to integrate with all the features described in the backend:
- Authentication
- User data access
- Notification consumption
- Messaging
- Encryption

## CMS plugins for one click integration

We are developing some plugins for popular CMS (Wordpress, Prestashop, ...) to help people using those tools to integrate Misakey tech.

We are looking for new integration, so feel free to develop some and propose them to integrate the official plugins !
