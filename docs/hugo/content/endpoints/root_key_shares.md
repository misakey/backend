## 1. Introduction

Key Splitting consists in splitting a secret key in several (currently, always two) *key shares*.
One share alone is completely useless, but by combining two shares of a key one can recover the secret key.

A key share has another attribute than its value,
it has an `other_share_hash` which is used for the guest frontend to identify which share it wants to retrieve.
Technically speaking, the hash is the SHA-512 hash of the other share.

## 2. Creating a root key share

### 2.1. request

```bash
POST https://api.misakey.com/root-key-shares
```

_Cookies:_
- `accesstoken` (opaque token) (ACR >= 2): the identity must be linked to an account and this account must fit the one given in the body
- `tokentype`: must be `bearer`

_Headers:_
- `X-CSRF-Token`: a token to prevent from CSRF attacks.

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/root-key-share-posted.json" %}}
```

- `account_id` (string) (uuid): the account for which the shares has been created.
- `share` (string) (base64): one of the shares.
- `other_share_hash` (string) (unpadded url-safe base64): a hash of the other share.

### 2.2. response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 201 CREATED
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/root-key-share-response.json" %}}
```

_Path Parameters:_
- `other-share-hash` (string): the hash of the key share.


### 3.2. response

_Code:_
